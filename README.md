An implementation of Dana Angluin's L* Algorithm for exactly learning DFAs in polynomial time as explained in Chapter 8: "Learning Finite Automata by Experimentation" in "An Introduction to Computational Learning Theory" by Micheal J. Kearns and Umesh V. Vazirani.

The DFA to be learned can be provided in the form of a text file (dfa.txt) or generated using a pseudo-random number generator.

The alphabet provided in the file alphabet.txt can be any size. If no alphabet is provided, the default alphabet is binary (0 and 1).

Python libraries required:
matplotlib, 
networkx
